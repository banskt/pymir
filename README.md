# PyMir

This is a disorganized collection of small Python utilities, which I regularly use in multiple projects.
If you are using any of my analysis projects, you might have to install this package.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/banskt/pymir.git -U
```
Then you can import the utilities:
```
import pymir
```

The name `pymir` comes from a "My Python" (not exactly literally, `mir` in German means `me`).
